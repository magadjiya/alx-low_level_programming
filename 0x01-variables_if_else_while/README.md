## Mandatory tasks

### Task 0
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. Run some conditions on it.

**Task file:** [0-positive\_or\_negative.c][Task 0]

### Task 1
Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. Assigns a random number, run some conditions for it.

**Task file:** [1-last\_digit.c][Task 1]

### Task 2
Using only putchar(), write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**Task file:** [2-print\_alphabet.c][Task 2]

### Task 3
With only putchar write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

**Task file:** [3-print\_alphabets.c][Task 3]

### Task 4
Print all lowercase letters except e & q. Use putchar twice only, end with new line.

**Task file:** [4-print\_alphabt.c][Task 4]

### Task 5
Print 0-9 only, followed by a new line.

**Task file:** [5-print\_numbers.c][Task 5]

### Task 6
Print 0-9 but with putchar only, end with a new line.

**Task file:** [6-print\_numberz.c][Task 6]

### Task 7
Print lowercase z to a. Use only putchar, end with new line.

**Task file:** [7-print\_tebahpla.c][Task 7]

### Task 8
Print base-16 numbers, i.e 0-f, followed by a new line.

**Task file:** [8-print\_base16.c][Task 8]

### Task 9
Putchar single integers 0-9, with commas and spaces in between. End with a new line.

**Task file:** [9-print\_comb.c][Task 9]

## Advanced tasks

### Task 10
Program that prints all possible unique combinations of 2 digit numbers(10 and 01 are the same).
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
- You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

**Task file:** [100-print\_comb3.c][Task 10]

### Task 11
C program that prints possible different combinations of three digits.
- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
- The three digits must be different
- 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
- Print only the smallest combination of three digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
- You can only use the putchar function
5- You can only use putchar six times maximum in your code
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

**Task file:** [101-print\_comb4.c][Task 11]

### Task 12
C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. Same instructions as above.

**Task file:** [102-print\_comb5.c][Task 012]


## My process

### Built with

- Shell
- C

### What I learned
I learned about conditionals in C, how to set them to check for something.
I learned the power of using '0' or simply 48 to show regular numbers when using putchar()
