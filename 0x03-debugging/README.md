## Mandatory tasks

### Task 0
You are given the source code for the C program.
file must test that the function positive\_or\_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

**Task file:** [0-main.c][Task 0]

### Task 1
You are given the source code, comment out the part(s) that are causing an infinite loop.

**Task file:** [1-main.c][Task 1]

### Task 2
Fix the source code so that it prints the largest number, no matter what.

**Task file:** [2-largest\_number.c][Task 2]

### Task 3
Fix the source code to print the remaining days for normal and leap years.

**Task file:** [3-print\_remaining\_days.c][Task 3]
